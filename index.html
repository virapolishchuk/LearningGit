    <h1>Shape of My Heart</h1>
    <p>by Sting</p>
    <div>
        <p>He deals the cards as a meditation<br>
            And those he plays never suspect<br>
            He doesn't play for the money he wins<br>
            He don't play for respect<br></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>He deals the cards to find the answer<br>
            The sacred geometry of chance<br>
            The hidden law of a probable outcome<br>
            The numbers lead a dance<br></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
            I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
            I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
            But that's not the shape of my heart<br></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>He may play the jack of diamonds<br>
            He may lay the queen of spades<br>
            He may conceal a king in his hand<br>
            While the memory of it fades<br></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
            I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
            I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
            But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
            That's not the shape<br>
            The shape of my heart<br></p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>If I told her that I loved you<br>
            You'd maybe think there's something wrong<br>
            I'm not a man of too many faces<br>
            The mask I wear is one<br></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>But those who speak know nothing<br>
            And find out to their cost<br>
            Like those who curse their luck in too many places<br>
            And those who fear are lost<br></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
            I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
            I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
            But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
            That's not the shape of my heart<br>
            That's not the shape<br>
            The shape of my heart</p>
